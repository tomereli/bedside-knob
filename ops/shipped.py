"""The block that goes at the end of "done".

Four facts, every time: what shipped, where to read it, what ran, and -- the
one he asked for by name -- whether anything opened the running thing after
the deploy.

Generated rather than typed. A hand-written footer carries a stale sha
eventually, and the whole value of this one is that he can trust it without
checking.

    python ops/shipped.py
    python ops/shipped.py --tag v1.2.0 --tests "44 labels, 0 errors" \
        --live "knob rejoined 11:15, wifi_signal published -86"

Ported from health-mcp/ops/shipped.py, which is the original. The format is
deliberately identical -- three lines, the same two links -- so a release
here reads the same as a release there.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT, and why: health-mcp reads what is live from a deploy
record its release engine writes. A knob has no such record, because its
deploy is a person running `esphome run` at a device. Until one exists
--tag is how you say which release you mean, and with no --tag this
describes the newest tag rather than claiming to know what is on the
hardware. It never guesses: a tag is not evidence that a device is running
it.

--live is a plain string and nothing here checks it. What makes it worth
reading is ops/verify.py, which refuses rather than passing when it cannot
look. Do not write this line by hand.
