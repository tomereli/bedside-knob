"""Did the device actually take the firmware that was just built?

    python ops/verify.py                      # this repo's device
    python ops/verify.py --device coffee-knob

Prints one line for ops/shipped.py --live, and exits 0 only when it proved
something. It REFUSES rather than passing: without a token, without a
reachable Home Assistant, or without the entity it needs, it says so and
exits 2. "We could not look" is not "it works", and a check that can be
skipped and still report green is decoration.

That rule is borrowed from health-mcp/ops/verify.py, whose own note says it
best: every other check there asked the server whether it was well, and on
2026-09-07 the server was perfect through four deploys while the app opened
to nothing.

WHAT IT PROVES, and why this and not something easier. A knob has no page to
render, so the analogue of "the app came up" is an observation only the new
firmware could produce. ESPHome's version text_sensor reports the config hash
the running binary was compiled from, and .esphome/build/<device>/
build_info.json holds the same number for what was just built. Equal means
the hardware is running THIS config. Not equal means it is running something
else, whatever `esphome run` said.

"The device rejoined the network" is deliberately NOT the test. That is this
project's healthz: necessary, cheap, and exactly the thing that stays green
while the wrong image runs.
